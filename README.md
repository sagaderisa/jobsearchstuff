Code for automating job search processes, generated with assistance from ChatGPT. 



CrunchbaseDataFixer.py - definitely not a way to circumvent Crunchbase's paid export feature. You may need to change the file names and/or column labels in the code, and/or the display data in Crunchbase. 


More background:

The problem:
- 70% of jobs are never posted publicly (https://www.apollotechnical.com/networking-statistics/#:~:text=or%20employer%20someday.-,Networking%20for%20Your%20Career,jobs%20are%20filled%20through%20networking.)
- 85% of jobs are filled through networking. ([Source](https://www.apollotechnical.com/networking-statistics/#:~:text=or%20employer%20someday.-,Networking%20for%20Your%20Career,jobs%20are%20filled%20through%20networking.))
- You are 15X more likely to get a job through a referral than if you blind apply to a job posting. (Source)

So the question is how do you prioritize who in your network to reach out to find jobs that arenâ€™t actually listed? 
- It's easier to get jobs at companies that are scaling up, meaning that they have likely recently received financing, which is data you can sort of get from Crunchbase. (See CrunchbaseDataFixer.py)
- You can also do Google searches like, "fastest growing company in [industry]"
- Once you have your list of companies, you can download your LinkedIn connection data (and/or friends' data) and cross reference it with the list of companies.
